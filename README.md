# ENGR 103: Linear Equations

## Getting Started

To begin the programming portion of this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Copy the SSH URL of this repository by clicking the "<> Code" button at the top right of the main page, selecting the "SSH" tab, and clicking the clipboard icon.
   - Open your terminal and connect to the ENGR servers via SSH.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store your assignment work using commands like `ls`, `pwd`, and `cd`.
   - Execute `git clone <SSH_connection_string>`.

2. **Navigate to the Repository**:
   - Execute `ls` to confirm the presence of a new directory named `linear-equations-XXX`, where `XXX` is your GitHub username.
   - Enter that directory using `cd linear-equations-XXX`.
   - Execute `ls` again to see this file (`README.md`) along with the starter code.
   - Use `vim` to edit and complete the starter code according to the assignment requirements.

Your work for part 1 should be in `revenue.cpp`, and for part 2 in `gardening.cpp`.

## Submitting Your Work

As you work on your assignment, frequently test your code and create new commits to reflect small changes. This practice allows you to rollback changes if needed.

To submit your work:

1. Ensure all your work is committed (`git status` should show no modified or staged files).
2. Push your commits to this GitHub repository using `git push`.
3. Open this repository in your browser, refresh the page, and verify it contains your latest work.

The instructor and TAs have access to this GitHub repository. As long as your work is pushed here, it is considered submitted. The timestamp of your latest commit will be checked to determine if it is a late submission.
